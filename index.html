        <h2>Who Are We Actually?</h2>
        
        <div class="content-card">
            <h3 style="color: #6b4d99;">Just Students Who created this whole online NIOS community</h3>
            <br>
            <p> We're literally  The PPL who created r/Nios_students, Nios unoffical discord server & that goated students <a href="https://nios-students.pages.dev/">
              website
            </a>. the PPL who created this overall community and ex-students who went through the same chaos you're facing right now. Forms that make no sense, deadlines that appear out of nowhere, and zero proper guidance anywhere .</p> <br>
            
            
            <p>We're not "education consultants" or "NIOS experts." We're just experienced. And honestly, that counts more here than fancy certificates.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card" style="text-align: center;">
                  <h3 style="color: #6b4d99;">Why Not Free? Why Not ‚Çπ10,000?</h3>
                  <p>We already help for free on subreddit (r/nios_students) & public Discord server (nios-unofficial), even made  <a href="https://nios-students.pages.dev/">
                  website
                  </a>. all this for free, but that is general, slow, and not one-on-one assistance like this. <br> <br>
                  We're not trying to become those "pay ‚Çπ10k or get lost" middlemen either.<br> <br> <p class="underline"> Its something we do to earn pocket money and sponsor our projects .</p></p>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3 style="color: #6b4d99;">The Goal</h3>
            <p>That you won't have to worry about 69 other nios things & just focus on your imp stuff</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
              <li>"Did I fill the right subject?"</li>
              <li>"What the hell is a PCP center?"</li>
              <li>"What the hell is a FA & SA??"</li>
              <li>"Where's my hall ticket?"</li>
                <li>"Am I too late for TMA?"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And start focusing on:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                <li>Just your studies</li>
                <li>Just your exams</li>
                <li>Just passing and getting it done</li>
